<p align="center">Your convenient online grocery store for random products.</p>

## 👀 Overview

The Shopping App simplifies your grocery shopping experience, bringing fresh produce directly to your doorstep. Our intuitive interface and streamlined checkout process make it effortless to browse, select, and order your favorite goods.

All the texts above are just AI-generated fancy bullshit. Feel free to ignore them.

## ⁉️ The Problem (aka Boredom Strikes Again)

- Boredom strikes, leading to a desire for a fun coding challenge.
- The thought: "Could I build an entire shopping app using mostly AI-generated code?"
- The challenge is too tempting to ignore.

## 🛟 The Solution (aka AI to the Rescue)

- Embracing the challenge, teaming up with AI tools.
- AI does about 69% of the work, writing code, documentation, and offering design suggestions.
- The developer (aka me) refines, debugs, and customizes the AI-generated output.
- Result: A functional online grocery store!
